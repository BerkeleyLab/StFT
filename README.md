# StFT: Spatio-temporal-Fourier-Transformer-for-Long-term-Dynamics-Prediction


## Training StFT

To train StFT on the plasma MHD dataset:
```bash
python train.py
```
By default, the results will be saved to the ray_results at home directory. To customize the saved direcotry, you can change the save_path variable in the train.py file.
